title: T-Mobile Buckles Under iPhone 6 PreOrders
---

When you are one of the major US carriers that allows its customers to pre-order the new Apple iPhone 6 and Apple iPhone 6 Plus, you would think that you would make sure your internal systems were up to snuff before the pre-order deadline. Well, as luck would have it, when September 12, 2014 rolled around, it turns out that many T-Mobile customers were out of luck when they went to try to pre-order the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.

Long before T-Mobile updated their website to say they were having difficulties and to try back later, many users had orders they could not complete, orders that were started, and then automatically canceled, and others still could not even access the shopping portion of the site to check to see whether the order they thought they had placed was actually still a valid order. The other fun portion of working with T-Mobile during this time is that when you called their support lines, the lines were so busy that there were recordings actively telling callers they were better off hanging up and calling back later instead of waiting on hold.

When you finally were able to reach an actual human on the phones, you were told that the T-Mobile systems were down for at least 48 hours, and to try back later.

I really do wonder how much business T-Mobile lost this past weekend when they were unable to keep up with the demand from customers for the latest iPhones from Apple.
