title: Social-Buttons.Com Spams Google Analytics
---

Typically when you see traffic in Google Analytics, you can be sure that it is legitimate traffic to your website. However, there are a few known spammers out there that successfully spam Google Analytics tracking codes with bogus visits, hoping that the Analytics users visit the site that is supposedly "referring" traffic. One such domain that is being used for this is Social-Buttons.com. 

I have just begun to see traffic in Google Analytics from Social-Buttons.com in the middle part of March 2015, and if you look at the Google Trends statistics for search terms of Social-Buttons.com, you can see that there is a spike in searches for Social-Buttons.com in March 2015 from a baseline of 0 searches prior to March 2015.

There is an excellent analysis of exactly who is behind this spam attack [here](https://www.mooresoftwareservices.com/Web-Commerce/social-buttons-com-referrer-spam), but it still proves to be an annoyance to webmasters seeking to measure traffic to their websites. If you want to rid yourself of these bogus visits, the solutions presented [here](http://viget.com/advance/removing-referral-spam-from-google-analytics) work for now until the spammers out-innovate these protections.
