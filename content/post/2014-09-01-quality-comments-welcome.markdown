title: Quality Comments Welcome
---

One of the things, among many, that has been missing from this blog from its beginning has been the inability for users to post comments to articles in the blog. [Ghost](http://ghost.org) was created to allow bloggers and writers to focus directly on writing with as few distractions as possible. This is in stark contrast to the way [WordPress](http://wordpress.com) was created where anyone running a site had to be immersed in the functionality of WordPress themes and extensions to have a fully-functional website.

However, one of the side-effects of this change in focus is that there are some things that come standard with WordPress, such as article comments, which are missing from the default installation of Ghost. Luckily, the great, free third-party commenting tool [Disqus](http://disqus.com) makes it easy to add user comments to any website, especially Ghost blogs. If you want to add Disqus comments to your Ghost blog, check out these [instructions](http://support.ghost.org/add-disqus-to-my-ghost-blog/) for adding it.

Now that comments are enabled, make sure to keep your comments constructive and ensure they contribute to the discussion, or else commenting privileges will be revoked and comments removed from this blog.
