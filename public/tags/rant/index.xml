      <description>One of the hallmarks of the Scrum method of agile software development is a daily meeting, or &amp;ldquo;standup&amp;rdquo;. The purpose of the Scrum Daily Standup is to make sure the Scrum team is aware of what tasks the other members of the team are working on as well as asking for and offering assistance to other members of the team as needed. The Scrum Daily Standup is NOT a meeting to gather the project&amp;rsquo;s status.</description>

      <title>How do you handle a developer that doesn&#39;t play by the rules?</title>

      <description>Software development teams are fickle groups. It seems everyone has their own pet peeves that set them off, and a group that is cohesive and functioning well can quickly turn into one that shows little output for the time spent working.
In order to create and nurture a software development team takes leadership that understands all of the idiosyncrasies of their team members, and ensure that no one member derails the rest of the team.</description>

      <title>SCRUM Sprint Planning Gone Wrong</title>
      <link>https://thegeekspeaks.net/post/2015-04-21-scrum-sprint-planning-gone-wrong/</link>

      <description>One of the things that is a hallmark of the SCRUM method of Agile development is that you have a unit of time during which you commit to accomplishing some amount of work before that unit of time has elapsed. In order to commit to how much work should be accomplished during the &amp;ldquo;sprint&amp;rdquo;, all members of the team meet at the beginning of each sprint for a sprint planning meeting.</description>

      <title>The Top Sign You Hired The Wrong Developer</title>

      <description>I have been a part of the interview process at a few different companies now, and there is one thing that I have seen correlate completely with how useless a developer hire is. If the hiring manager ever brings me a resume that mentions how many conferences a candidate attends or gives talks at, I will immediately rule that candidate out for the purposes of the development position I am interviewing for.</description>

      <description>I am used to hearing people use phrases like &amp;ldquo;I want to be able to do X thing&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I want to have X position at my company&amp;rdquo; when people are talking in generalities about their goals. I tend to do it often as well, especially when using &amp;ldquo;self-talk&amp;rdquo; to attempt to work on internal goals and desires. However, when reading a book from Paul Tough, How Children Succeed, one of the quotes that he references from Jonathan Rowson, a Scottish chess grand master who had written about the importance of emotion and psychology in chess success.</description>

      <description>From time to time, my job allows me to be a part of the hiring process for our technical positions. Unfortunately for some of the applicants, I repeatedly come away from these interviews amazed at the responses I get from pretty standard and basic technical questions related to Web Development.
Recently we were looking for a front-end web developer that was good at UX and design and proficient at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</description>

      <description>Every year, we are treated to a big show from Apple about what the next iPhone will be like, and how magical it actually is. In case you have been living under a rock, this major Apple annoucement is one of the largest news-making fancy press-conferences you will see these days. It used to be this way when Microsoft would launch a new operating system, remember that launch announcement and launch party for Windows XP?</description>

      <description>With the recent revelation that there was a massive release of naked or revealing photographs of many female celebrities, it seems to be an important time to remind people how to make sure private photos and other information don&amp;rsquo;t get shared all around the internet without your permission. As a result, here are my top 5 ways to keep your nude pictures secure.
  Don&amp;rsquo;t Take Nude Selfies - Yes, the best and easiest way to keep your naked selfies out of the sight for the public viewers on the internet is to never take a naked selfie in the first place.</description>

      <title>Google Chrome Makes Web Developers Lazy</title>

      <description>This post may make me sound ancient in the world of web development, but here it comes anyway.
 Like Microsoft, Google has decided to implement functionality in their dominant browser that is incompatible with the other major competing browsers.
 When I first started developing websites professionally, ensuring a website worked for 99% of the site&amp;rsquo;s visitors was easy, relatively, as you only needed to make sure the site worked in Internet Explorer 6.</description>

      <title>Links Not Working? Check AdBlock Plus</title>
      <link>https://thegeekspeaks.net/post/2014-07-28-links-not-working-check-adblock-plus/</link>

      <guid>https://thegeekspeaks.net/post/2014-07-28-links-not-working-check-adblock-plus/</guid>
      <description>It turns out that the issues with useForcedLinkTracking are not isolated just to Safari&amp;rsquo;s popup blocker. Unfortunately, one of the most popular browser for both Chrome and Firefox, AdBlock Plus is subject to this issue as well.
One of the things that the AdBlock Plus plugin does is attempt to intercept any and all link traffic to determine whether it was created from an actual mouse click or if it was triggered through JavaScript as part of a marketing campaign.</description>

      <description>Throughout a normal day, I end up reading a lot of information about current issues in technology, and today is no different. There was a debate raging about whether or not high-level math was required for programmers that was sparked by this article by Sarah Mei Programming is not math. While it is an interesting topic, and, surprisingly, I mostly agree with Sarah on this issue, that is not the most important portion of her post.</description>

      <title>The Easiest Way to Create A Solution That Works</title>

      <description>The easiest way to create a solution that works&amp;hellip;is to do it right the first time. Yes, this is a bit of a cop-out, but it turns out to be an important factor to keep in mind when you are tempted to come up with a quick and dirty solution for a problem that does not follow established best practices and is likely to have code quality issues later.
I have run across many sections of code that I or other developers have written in the past that we thought were &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; at the time it was written, yet, I was revisiting the code because we discovered a bug in it.</description>

      <title>Estimating Software Development Projects is Hard</title>

      <guid>https://thegeekspeaks.net/post/2014-07-11-estimating-software-development-projects-is-hard/</guid>
      <description>As a software developer, working with non-technical management and end users to define a deadline for when a project will be ready to use or how long it will take from start to end of a project is an extremely complex task. Unfortunately, the non-technical audience thinks that it should be simple to give some sort of estimation on the fly without detailed analysis of the project and what it involves, as it seems simple for them to estimate tasks that are like ones they have done before.</description>

      <description>When looking for an online location to use as the host for source code, many people by default look at GitHub, as it seems to be the most well-known option out there, and is free for open source projects. However, if you would like your source code to be kept private, or would rather use Mercurial instead of Git, GitHub may not be the place for you. Instead, I would suggest BitBucket as your source code repository provider.</description>

      <title>Code Style Guides - Consistency is King</title>

      <description>There have been countless flame wars online about the details of the guidelines that appear in various Code Style Guides. Some of the most famous are the tabs versus spaces arguments, whether or not to put curly brackets {} each on their own line, whether you should even use the curly brackets {} for one line actions in if statements.
I am here to say that the only thing that matters in the style of your source code, other than syntactically correct code, is consistency.</description>

      <description>As a developer that frequently leads projects and operates in various leadership roles depending on the current project lineup, the Agile development methodology is a welcome change from the Waterfall and Software Development Life Cycle approaches to software development. SCRUM is the specific type of Agile development that I have participated in at a few different workplaces, and it seems to work well if implemented properly. However, there are several ways to make a SCRUM development team perform more poorly than it ought.</description>

      <description>All sites rely upon some third party analytics software to track at the very least the number of visitors to a site. Many sites use Google Analytics, which provide much more information that just the number of visitors. Another option that some of the bigger sites use is Adobe Analytics, aka SiteCatalyst to enable more custom tracking options that are not evident through the Google Analytics interface.
One feature of SiteCatalyst is that it allows you to set an option useForcedLinkTracking that will track every link on your site for clicks whether or not you have setup custom tracking for the links or not.</description>

      <description>Developing a website that works well across devices and browsers is an excersize in playing Whack-A-Mole. Once you get one browser working on a desktop browser, you go to the next browser and find that not everything works the same way. In 2014, it seems that there aren&amp;rsquo;t that many differences in functionality between desktop browsers, but that all changes once you start making a responsive website that must handle mobile devices as well as it does desktop browsers.</description>

      <title>Magento Version 2, is it just Microsoft Windows Longhorn AKA Vista?</title>

      <description>Magento version 2 was first introduced in 2010. It is now almost halfway through 2014, and the public has not seen any alpha or beta release of Magento version 2 as of yet. The new version of Magento promised to replace PrototypeJS and Scriptaculus with jQuery as well as reorganize the database schema to remove the slow EAV tables and migrate to a bit of a flatter table structure. However, it seems that the latest updates on the direction for Magento 2 show that the database schema will not be changed much after all.</description>

      <description>Developers are known to be some of the most finicky employees you will encounter in the workplace. However, this is a list of things that will annoy or infuriate developers and non-developers alike.
 Have the IT Manager send an email to all staff saying that all computers will have a keylogger installed. &amp;ndash; This one is wrong on so many levels, the least of which is that it shows how little faith the company has in its employees and breeds mistrust of authority.</description>
