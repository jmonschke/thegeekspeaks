      <description>One of the hallmarks of the Scrum method of agile software development is a daily meeting, or &amp;ldquo;standup&amp;rdquo;. The purpose of the Scrum Daily Standup is to make sure the Scrum team is aware of what tasks the other members of the team are working on as well as asking for and offering assistance to other members of the team as needed. The Scrum Daily Standup is NOT a meeting to gather the project&amp;rsquo;s status.</description>
