      <description>I have been a part of the interview process at a few different companies now, and there is one thing that I have seen correlate completely with how useless a developer hire is.

      <description>From time to time, my job allows me to be a part of the hiring process for our technical positions. Unfortunately for some of the applicants, I repeatedly come away from these interviews amazed at the responses I get from pretty standard and basic technical questions related to Web Development.
Recently we were looking for a front-end web developer that was good at UX and design and proficient at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</description>
