      <description>I was excited when the Docker team launched their better-integrated solution for running Docker containers on OS X this past summer. It allowed our team to switch from using full Vagrant/Virtual Box based virtual machines for local development to a much lighter-weight solution.

However, when trying to setup a similar environment with Magento 2, the performance numbers didn&amp;rsquo;t quite line up when using a macOS host.</description>
