Google recently announced that beginning April 21, 2015, they would start slightly rewarding websites that are mobile-friendly at the expense of sites that are not. There are several things that Google looks at to determine whether or not a site is easy for a user on a mobile device to view and navigate. Some of the things that Google looks for include the following:

1. Fonts that are big enough to be legible
1. Users don't have to scroll left and right to see content
1. Links are big enough and have enough space around them to be clickable with a touch of a finger.
1. Avoids technologies that are not present on mobile devices, like Flash.

If you make sure that you follow the above guidelines, your site will be prepared for the upcoming change in Google's search results. To find out more, check out Google's [blog](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2014/11/helping-users-find-mobile-friendly-pages.html) post.
